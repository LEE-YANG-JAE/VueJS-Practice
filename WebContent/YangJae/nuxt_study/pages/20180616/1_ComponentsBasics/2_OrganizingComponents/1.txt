It’s common for an app to be organized into a tree of nested components:

Component Tree

For example, you might have components for a header, sidebar, and content area, 
each typically containing other components for navigation links, blog posts, etc.

To use these components in templates, they must be registered 
so that Vue knows about them. There are two types of component registration: global and local. 
So far, we’ve only registered components globally, using Vue.component:

Vue.component('my-component-name', {
  // ... options ...
})
Globally registered components can be used in the template of any root Vue instance (new Vue) created afterwards 
– and even inside all subcomponents of that Vue instance’s component tree.

That’s all you need to know about registration for now, 
but once you’ve finished reading this page and feel comfortable with its content, 
we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on Component Registration(https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-registration.html)
