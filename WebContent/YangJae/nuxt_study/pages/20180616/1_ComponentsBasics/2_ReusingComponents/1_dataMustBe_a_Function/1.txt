When we defined the <button-counter> component, you may have noticed that data wasn’t directly provided an object, like this:

data: {
  count: 0

data: function () {
  return {
    count: 0
  }
}

If Vue didn’t have this rule, clicking on one button would affect the data of all other instances, like below:
