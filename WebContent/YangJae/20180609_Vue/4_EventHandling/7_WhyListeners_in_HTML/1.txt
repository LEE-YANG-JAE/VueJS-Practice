There are several benefits in using v-on:

1. It’s easier to locate the handler function implementations within your JS code by skimming the HTML template.

2. Since you don’t have to manually attach event listeners in JS, your ViewModel code can be pure logic and DOM-free. This makes it easier to test.

3. When a ViewModel is destroyed, all event listeners are automatically removed. You don’t need to worry about cleaning it up yourself.
